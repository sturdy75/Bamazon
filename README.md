##Bamazon Marketplace

* The Bamazon app is a demonstration using SQL to create a database of products with corresponding ID's, categories, prices and quantity levels. It allows the user to see a list of items and prompts them to select one for purchase. Once an item number has been entered, the user is then directed to decide how many of the item they want to buy. If there is sufficient inventory the user is informed that the purchase is approved and is given a total for their purchase.

This project is made to show the functionality of using SQL, node.js, and JavaScript together to make the creation and updating of a database a seamless endeavor.

To make use of this app the user must simply follow the prompts on screen to begin the process.
